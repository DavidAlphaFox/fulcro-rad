(defn transient-blob-store
  "Create a blob store that uses a map of entries to track file uploads and saves the actual files to local
  temp files on disk. The `max-store-mins` is a time (in minutes) after which blobs in this store will disappear.

  This store is useful as the temporary store for file uploads on forms that have not yet been saved. Be sure to set
  the time high enough that it won't clean up uploaded things that have not been put in the database yet. You might
  also think about adding auto-save to forms that have uploads.

  This store can also be used as a development-time store if you're ok with them disappearing on restarts.

  * `base-url` is the prefix to use for returning URLs for a blob in this store.
  * `max-store-mins` is the maximum time after which files will be removed from disk.

  NOTE: file cleanup happens on the next `save-blob!`. Restarting the server can cause some of the temporary files
  that were being tracked by this store to be left on disk."
